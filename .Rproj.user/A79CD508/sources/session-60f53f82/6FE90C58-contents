# Essay Questions

::: panel-tabset

## 1. Reflection Question 1: In Step 1, you learned how to design stunning presentation slides with Quarto. What's your impression of the Revealjs presentation? Describe its capabilities as you learned from the presentations. What are its strengths and weaknesses compared with PPT?

To be completely honest, I had a really hard time understanding the video because the audio was not great, I'm not sure if it was just my computer/internet connection but I did have issues throughout. I was able to follow along visually and while I did understand some part of it, it would have been even more helpful if i could have heard Dr. Jung's explanation for what he was doing.

My impression from the video, is that a Quarto , Revealjs, presentation gives you the ability to create modern slides and the best part is that you can still edit the backend of the presentation and the live link will reflect those changes especially when working with specific datasets and code. Compared to PowerPoint, Reveal.js is web-based, and easily version-controlled, making it ideal for data science. However, it does have a steeper learning curve for those unfamiliar with R Studio or coding, and fewer built-in animations and visual transitions than PowerPoint.Even though R studio has a visual editor, PowerPoint is a lot easier to see a complete finished slide.

## 2. Reflection Question 2: Provide a link to the presentation you published on the web. Add at least one reproducible chart or table In the presentation. Briefly describe what the presentation is about. What did you learn from the experience of the Revealjs presentation?

[My Revealjs Presentation](http://localhost:4505/#/title-slide)

To practice creating a Revealjs presentation, I used the current MSDM Culminating Project information. I stated the business probelm currently facing the Airline Industry and how customer satisfaction affects it. I also introduced one of the analytic objectives which is how flight delays can influence customer satisfaction with the airline.

I thought it was really cool how I was able to create the presentation and summarize a lot of the information that was in the written report. My favorite part was learning that I can create tables/charts to summarize some of the information on the actual presentation, and I did realize that even after publishing it, I made edits to some of the tables and it was automatically reflected on the online version of the presentation I did not have to render again so I thought that was really cool. I am looking forward to learning more about creating presentations in R studio!

## 3. Reflection Question 3: My advanced wrangling lecture in Step 2 introduced some new concepts, such as joining relational databases. Pick three different functions, each from a different category. Describe when to use them and give one coding example along with an output for each function. To clarify, you are expected to do literate programming to weave your narratives with the codes.

In Step 2, I was introduced to advanced wrangling techniques using the dplyr package, particularly in the context of joining relational data. One of the most useful functions is left_join(), which belongs to the relational join category. This function is used when I want to keep all records from one dataset and match data from another table where keys align. For example:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
customers <- tibble(customer_id = c(1, 2, 3), name = c("Janette", "Sandra", "Roger"))
orders <- tibble(customer_id = c(1, 3), order_total = c(250, 400))

left_join(customers, orders, by = "customer_id")

```

I also learned more about `filter()`, which falls under the **row filtering** category. It is used to extract rows that meet specific conditions, such as finding only delayed flights in an airline dataset. This will be very helpful for my culminating project. For example:

```{r}
flights <- tibble(flight = c("UA101", "UA102", "UA103"), delay = c(0, 45, 120))
filter(flights, delay > 30)

```

The last function I learned more about was the `mutate()` function. This function will be useful when creating new variables or modifying existing ones. For example, if I want to create a new varaible for our data set that eliminates flight delays that are more than 24 hours.

```{r}
mutate(flights, delay_level = if_else(delay > 60, "Severe", "Moderate"))

```
