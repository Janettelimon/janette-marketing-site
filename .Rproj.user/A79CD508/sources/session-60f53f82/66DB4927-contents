Project 1: Sabor a Limon â€“ Website Creation

For my Web Design Project, I created a website for a gourmet cupcake business, "Sabor a Limon." Initially built with WordPress, I later transitioned to Weebly for better customization. The website (https://saboralimon.weebly.com) allows users to browse and order cupcakes. I learned how to use CMS platforms, embed contact forms, and manage basic HTML. Despite some challenges with image uploads and content layout, the project taught me the balance of technical skills and creative organization in website design.

Project 2: Cal Poly Pomona Farm Store Marketing Proposal

This proposal aimed to increase community engagement and sales through monthly farmers markets and farm-to-table events. Our team proposed strategic partnerships with local vendors and AGRIscapes to create memorable, family-friendly experiences. Key deliverables included a brand report, customer preference analysis, and a plan to build a CRM database for better customer insights.

Project 3: The Role of Social Media in Building Student Community

This research examined how platforms like Instagram and Discord foster a sense of community at Cal Poly Pomona. Through a student survey and MANOVA analysis, we found that Instagram boosted social connection and engagement, while Discord supported academic collaboration. The project highlighted how specific platforms can uniquely support different aspects of student life.
