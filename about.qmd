My name is Janette Limon, and I’m currently a second-year Master of Science in Digital Marketing (MSDM) student at Cal Poly Pomona. I also earned my bachelor’s degree in Communications with an emphasis in Public Relations from Cal Poly Pomona.

Professionally, I have exclusively worked in the public sector. I previously worked for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Field Representative, supporting various communications-related tasks. Currently, I serve as the Media & Marketing Coordinator at a local nonprofit, where I manage social media across various programs, maintain our website, plan and attend community events, and analyze social media engagement metrics.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new places, watching my nephews play baseball, and pursuing hobbies like sewing, reading, and shopping.
